# Ubuntu 24.04 + LabVIEW 2026 Community — from-scratch VM (VirtualBox / VMware parity)

A **reproducible, from-scratch** recipe that builds an **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS + LabVIEW 2026 Community** VM on
either hypervisor **from nothing but the stock public Ubuntu ISO**. We distribute **no VM image** — the
**agent** downloads the stock Ubuntu ISO from the vendor (releases.ubuntu.com) after **explicit user
approval** + `SHA256SUMS` verification, then creates + provisions the VM locally; the user's ONLY job is
activating LabVIEW. "VM creation from scratch" is the shipped feature.

This recipe produces the **golden VM** (one image). Replicating it into a *mesh of many instances* is a
separate downstream stage driven by **Vagrant** — see [Downstream — meshing](#downstream--meshing-vagrant).
The builder here and Vagrant compose; they do not compete.

- **VirtualBox** = the LINUX-plane reference (`build-virtualbox.sh` here).
- **VMware** = the WIN-plane mirror (WIN authors `build-vmware.*`; same guest spec + the same
  `provision-guest.sh` — only the hypervisor-creation step differs).
- **Activation is the operator's step.** The recipe installs LabVIEW Community *unactivated*; the operator
  signs in with an NI account to activate (once per VM). WIN flags "ready for activation" when the VMware
  VM boots green.

## Ground truth — the operator's working VM

The reference these scripts reproduce is the operator's activated VirtualBox VM
`lba-ubuntu2404-labview2026`. Its captured hardware profile (the spec the builders match):

| Property            | Value                                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Guest OS            | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat), 64-bit (`Ubuntu24_LTS_64`) |
| LabVIEW             | 2026 Community                                              |
| Firmware / chipset  | BIOS / PIIX3                                                 |
| RAM / vCPU          | 12288 MB / 6                                                |
| VRAM / gfx          | 128 MB / `vmsvga`                                            |
| System disk         | SATA (IntelAhci) VDI, dynamic                               |
| Optical             | IDE (PIIX4) — install ISO, ejected after install            |
| Network             | NIC1 NAT                                                     |
| Snapshot workflow   | `labview2026-installed-preactivation` → `labview2026-activated-ready` |

## Prerequisites (both planes)

1. The hypervisor: **VirtualBox** (LINUX) or **VMware Workstation** (WIN).
2. The **stock Ubuntu 24.04 ISO** — the **agent** downloads it from the vendor (releases.ubuntu.com) after
   **explicit user approval** and verifies it against the vendor `SHA256SUMS`; it's the only "image", and
   it's the vendor's, not ours. No approval => the agent does not download.
3. Nothing else — the NI LabVIEW 2026 Community apt repo + package are baked into `provision-guest.sh`
   (public keyring bundled). Only **LabVIEW activation** needs you (an NI account) — see below.

## VirtualBox (LINUX plane)

```bash
cd cleanroom/ubuntu-labview

# 1) Preview the exact VBoxManage commands (safe — creates nothing):
./build-virtualbox.sh

# 2) Build for real. Keep the disposable credential in a private file and explicitly
#    select a collision-free host-loopback port for NAT forwarding:
chmod 600 /safe/local/path/actor-password
ISO=/path/to/ubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso \
GUEST_PASSWORD_FILE=/safe/local/path/actor-password \
SSH_HOST_PORT=2222 \
./build-virtualbox.sh --run
```

The builder is **safe by default** (dry-run) and **refuses to touch an existing VM** of the same name
(so it can never clobber `lba-ubuntu2404-labview2026`). The guest defaults to the **`actor`** identity
(user `actor`, hostname `actor`, passwordless sudo via `provision-guest.sh`) for cross-plane parity with
the Windows cleanroom. Override the spec via env vars —
`VM_NAME DISK_GB MEM_MB CPUS VRAM_MB OSTYPE_ID BASEFOLDER GUEST_USER GUEST_FULLNAME GUEST_HOSTNAME`.
There is no credential default: `--run` requires `GUEST_PASSWORD_FILE`, and the file content is never placed in
arguments, output, receipts, or source. `SSH_HOST_PORT` is optional and, when set, creates only a
`127.0.0.1:<port>` NAT forward to guest port 22; the builder never exposes SSH to the LAN.

VirtualBox 7.2.8's supported unattended `--post-install-template` hook runs
`base-bootstrap.sh` in the installed target before the first reboot. It installs and enables OpenSSH, Git, and
Ubuntu's `virtualbox-guest-utils`, then enables a fail-closed first-boot validator. The final non-secret receipt is:

```text
/var/lib/lba-cleanroom/base-bootstrap-receipt.json
```

The receipt records Ubuntu and VM identity, absolute tool paths and versions, SSH and guest-utils active states,
wall-clock and monotonic phase timings, failures, and the outcome. A missing template, unsupported VirtualBox hook,
wrong OS, non-VirtualBox guest, missing package, or inactive required service fails closed. This base bootstrap is
deliberately separate from `provision-guest.sh`: it makes the fresh OS remotely automatable but does not install,
launch, or activate LabVIEW.

VM creation or a completed installer alone is not readiness proof: automation must require the first-boot receipt's
`outcome` to be `PASS`.

The production golden definition in `production-golden-box.Vagrantfile` revalidates this same receipt on every
Vagrant clone. `production-golden-box.metadata.json` binds the exact definition and required package guards.
`golden-activation-cycle.ps1 -Mode Package` refuses to halt, replace, or package the VM until the base receipt,
console acknowledgement, functional activation, identity freshness, and definition metadata all validate. Its v2
package receipt binds the exact base receipt, embedded Vagrantfile, metadata, activation receipt, and local box
bytes. Governed production packaging rejects `-ProductionVagrantfile` overrides; change the tracked definition and
metadata together instead. The repository does not publish that personal box.

The normalized live base proof is `production-golden-base-proof.json`. It records a fresh stock-ISO VM reaching
SSH-ready without graphical login in 952.458405s, with 5s bounded polling, Git/SSH/guest-utils PASS, zero recovery
actions, and complete disposable-VM cleanup. Text definition hashes are canonicalized to LF so the same proof
validates on Windows and Linux checkouts. This proof covers the pre-LabVIEW base boundary; it does not replace the
separate activation and identity-freshness evidence required by `-Mode Package`.

Verify the OS-type id on your host with `VBoxManage list ostypes | grep -i ubuntu`.

## VMware (WIN plane) — the mirror

WIN builds the **same guest** with VMware's own from-scratch path — **only the creation step differs**;
the guest spec + `provision-guest.sh` are identical, which is the whole parity contract. Recommended path:

1. `vmrun` / VMware Workstation "New VM" → **Ubuntu 64-bit**, firmware **BIOS**, **12288 MB / 6 vCPU /
   128 MB display**, a single **NVMe or SCSI** system disk (VMware's default; the AHCI/NVMe controller
   choice is the one benign VMware-vs-VBox divergence), NAT networking, attach the **stock Ubuntu 24.04
   ISO** to the virtual optical drive.
2. Use VMware's **Easy Install / autoinstall** (or a manual Ubuntu install) to install Ubuntu 24.04, OpenSSH,
   Git, and `open-vm-tools` (VMware's Guest-Additions equivalent — the per-provider guest-tools seam).
3. In the guest, run the **identical** `provision-guest.sh` to install LabVIEW 2026 Community (unactivated).
4. Snapshot `labview2026-installed-preactivation`, then **flag the operator** "ready for activation".

WIN: land this as `cleanroom/ubuntu-labview/build-vmware.ps1` (or `.sh`) so both build paths live side by
side. The provider-specific delta is the VM-creation step + the guest-tools package
(`virtualbox-guest-utils` vs `open-vm-tools`) — everything downstream is shared.

## LabVIEW install

`provision-guest.sh` installs LabVIEW 2026 Community **unactivated** from NI's apt repo — the exact,
**authoritative** feed + package (mirrored from the maintainer host that runs LabVIEW 2026 Community):

- Repo: `deb https://download.ni.com/ni-linux-desktop/LabVIEW/2026/Q1/f1/community/deb/ni-labview-2026/noble noble ni-labview-2026`
- Keyring: `ni-labview-2026-noble-community.asc` (a **public** PGP key, bundled next to the script)
- Metapackage: **`ni-labview-2026-community`** (v `26.1.1.49170-0+f18` — LabVIEW 2026 Q1)

It runs with no arguments:

```bash
sudo ./provision-guest.sh
```

Override `NI_REPO` / `NI_SUITE` / `LABVIEW_PKG` / `NI_KEYRING` only if NI moves the feed.

## Activation (operator only)

After `provision-guest.sh`, the operator signs in with an NI account to activate LabVIEW Community, then
snapshots `labview2026-activated-ready`. **The scripts never automate activation** — it needs human
credentials and is intentionally the operator's step, on both the VirtualBox and VMware VMs.

## Downstream — meshing (Vagrant)

This recipe builds the **golden VM** (one Ubuntu 24.04 + LabVIEW 2026 Community image, from scratch).
**Vagrant's role is the next stage**: it launches *many* copies of that golden VM for meshing experiments —
it is not another way to build the golden VM. The two stages compose:

```
stock Ubuntu 24.04 ISO
  |- build-virtualbox.sh (from scratch) --> golden VM (LabVIEW 2026 Community, unactivated)
       |- sudo ./provision-lbabus-fromsource.sh --> bake SDK + pinned source + vendored cache; lbabus BUILDS FROM SOURCE on first boot
       |- operator activates --> snapshot labview2026-activated-ready
            |- vagrant package --> self-contained golden box (e.g. vihs/labview-ubuntu2404-sc)
                 |- Vagrant multi-VM topology --> N instances coordinating over `lbabus net` (TCP 7420 / UDP 7421)
```

`provision-lbabus-fromsource.sh` makes each VM **build lbabus itself from source on first boot** — the only
lbabus path (no pre-built binary download). Run once on the golden box **before `vagrant package`**: it installs
the .NET SDK, bakes the **pinned** collab-cli source (`/opt/lba/src`) + a **vendored offline NuGet cache**
(`/opt/lba/nuget`), and enables a first-boot `systemd` oneshot that publishes a self-contained single-file
`lbabus` **fully offline** into `/usr/local/bin`. No binary is baked, so **every mesh clone rebuilds lbabus on
its first boot** (`ConditionPathExists=!/usr/local/bin/lbabus`) and can then run `lbabus net beacon`/`listen`
(TCP 7420 / UDP 7421). Immediately after the build, **`lba-gate-suite.service`** self-certifies the freshly
built binary with the offline, binary-only gate suite (the `verify-linux` subset: `version` + the
`agents`/`docs` embed round-trip + drift-detection gates — no mock, port, extra build, or network) and writes
**`/opt/lba/gate-suite-receipt.json`**, so every clean-room first boot is a self-certifying CI run whose
verdict is durable evidence (and, when `LBA_GATE_BEACON_HOSTS` is set, is beaconed over the `lbabus` bus to a
UDP observer). The `collab-cli-v*` release remains a tagged **source** snapshot for provenance; no consumer
downloads its binary.

Once the golden VM is activated, package it into a self-contained box and mesh N copies with the same
pattern as [experiments/multi-vm-topology](../../experiments/multi-vm-topology) (there in its Windows form:
box `vihs/labview-cleanroom-sc`, `vmware_desktop`, two actors on a host-only `private_network` proving
CLAIM/ACK/HANDOFF/DONE + UDP presence — LBA-REQ-006/007). An Ubuntu mesh mirrors it 1:1 — swap the
communicator to **ssh**, the box to the Ubuntu golden box, and the provider to **virtualbox** (LINUX) or
**vmware_desktop** (WIN). Vagrant is cross-provider, so the *same* topology meshes on both planes.

### Agent-friendly mesh cycle

For the checked-out VMware mesh, use the lifecycle wrapper instead of manually issuing separate destroy,
up, provision, and SSH verification commands:

```powershell
pwsh -File cleanroom/ubuntu-labview/mesh/provision-cycle.ps1 -Plan
pwsh -File cleanroom/ubuntu-labview/mesh/provision-cycle.ps1 -VerifyReceipt
pwsh -File cleanroom/ubuntu-labview/mesh/provision-cycle.ps1 -Apply
pwsh -File cleanroom/ubuntu-labview/mesh/provision-cycle.ps1 -Replace
```

`-Plan` validates the ignored local `mesh-actors.csv` and reports the cheapest safe action without changing
VMs. `-VerifyReceipt` validates the current non-secret receipt's content digest and input fingerprints without
changing VMs. `-Apply` verifies healthy unchanged actors in place, or runs only Vagrant up/provision when the
source pin, mesh worker, provisioner, or local registry fingerprint changed. It never destroys actors.
`-Replace` is the explicit clean-slate path: it rebuilds only the currently declared mesh actors.

The v2 receipt at `cleanroom/ubuntu-labview/mesh/.vagrant/provision-cycle-receipt.json` is UTF-8, content-bound,
and non-secret. It records the public topology, pinned source, provisioning input hashes, actor proof summaries,
and a SHA-256 digest. Topology, provider, or Vagrantfile drift requires `-Replace`; safe implementation drift
can use `-Apply`.

Actor removal is deliberately not automatic. Before removing an actor from `mesh-actors.csv`, explicitly run
`vagrant destroy -f <hostname>` in `cleanroom/ubuntu-labview/mesh`; then make the topology change and use
`-Replace`. This prevents an agent from silently destroying a VM no longer declared in the local registry.

For the Vagrant production-golden path, use the enforced sequence in [ACTIVATION.md](ACTIVATION.md):
`Provision` (including a reboot and LabVIEWCLI/console check), `ConsoleReady -OperatorDesktopConfirmed`,
`Handoff`, `Confirm`, then `Package`. Packaging is blocked unless a fresh identity-bound functional receipt and its
post-confirmation challenge still match the current guest; this prevents a pre-activation snapshot from being
packaged or enrolled as activated.
