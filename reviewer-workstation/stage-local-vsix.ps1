.SYNOPSIS
  Stage the LOCAL labview-benchmark-actor .vsix onto the RUNNING reviewer VM for human visual inspection --
  the "last gate" before publishing to the VS Code Marketplace.

.DESCRIPTION
  Companion to provision.ps1, but for the PRE-PUBLISH candidate. provision.ps1 pulls a PUBLISHED `ext-v*`
  release; THIS script builds the candidate from the current working tree and installs THAT, so a human can
  visually inspect the real extension + its documentation (the Marketplace README page, the command surface,
  the benchmark viewer, the embedded agent instructions) before anything is published.

  Steps (host-side, over the WinRM communicator):
    1. build + package the candidate .vsix on the host (npm test + vsce package), unless -SkipBuild;
    2. guard the .vsix size (a fat .vsix means .vscodeignore leaked non-runtime content, e.g. the VM disk);
    3. `vagrant upload` it into the guest;
    4. `code --install-extension --force` in the guest and verify the id@version;
    5. drop a Marketplace-review checklist into C:\lba-review for the reviewer.

  Re-runnable. Requires the reviewer VM already up:
    VAGRANT_CWD=reviewer-workstation vagrant up --provider vmware_desktop   # (WIN) or --provider virtualbox (LINUX)

labview-benchmark-actor -- PRE-PUBLISH visual review (Marketplace last gate)

You are inspecting the LOCAL candidate .vsix (built from the working tree), not a
published release. Install is already done. Open VS Code in THIS VM and inspect:

A. Marketplace listing surface (the README page)
   - Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) -> "LabVIEW Benchmark Actor" -> Details tab.
   - Confirm: display name, description, version, publisher, README renders with no
     broken images/links, categories look right. This is what Marketplace visitors see.

B. Command surface (Ctrl+Shift+P -> "LabVIEW Benchmark Actor:")
   - Open Benchmark Viewer        -> the mprr metric series renders with a draggable time cursor.
   - Show Agent Instructions      -> the embedded AGENTS.md opens.
   - Write Agent Instructions     -> materializes AGENTS.md into the open folder.
   - Check Agent Instructions     -> reports match/drift vs the embedded canonical.
   - Show Host Capabilities / Poll Bus / Post Note -> reviewer staging installs `lbabus`; restart VS Code so
     the extension host inherits its updated user PATH. Configure a bus peer before Poll/Post.

C. Documentation
   - README (above) is the shipped doc surface. Deeper specs (SRS/ADRs/user guide) are in
     the repo under docs/ if you want to cross-check wording.

Verdict: if A + B look publish-ready, this candidate is cleared for the Marketplace.
Report issues back to the agent; nothing is published until you approve.
