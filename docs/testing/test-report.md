> This is the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 **test report** (executed verification evidence and completion
> criteria) and the ISO 10007 / ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 **configuration status accounting** record for the
> repository. It records the controlled state of the verification apparatus, not one ad-hoc run: every
> item below is enforced fail-closed in CI on every pull request, so "current" means "as enforced on
> the tip of `develop`". The complementary test **plan** (design of what to test) is
> `docs/testing/test-plan.md`.

## 1. Completion criteria (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2)

Testing is **complete** for a change when **every governed gate passes fail-closed** in CI on both
`ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest`. A single red gate blocks merge; there is no manual sign-off path
that can override a red gate. The completion criteria are therefore machine-checked and
non-discretionary — the same apparatus runs locally (`node experiments/verify-local-gates.mjs`) and in
the `LBA Local Gates verify` CI job.

## 2. Executed verification evidence (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3)

### 2.1 Local gate suite — 196 fail-closed checks

Run by `node experiments/verify-local-gates.mjs`. All must pass. The full gate inventory (the executed
test items at the gate granularity) is:

### 2.2 Correspondence graph — 7 fail-closed rules

Run by `node experiments/reqs-coverage/verify-correspondences.mjs` (also invoked as gates). Each rule
is a structural invariant across the governed information items:

| Rule | Enforced | Invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TR-1 | yes | test<->requirement (every governed test corresponds to >=1 requirement) |
| AD-1 | yes | ADR<->requirement + register (every ADR traces to a requirement and is registered in overview.md) |
| VW-1 | yes | requirement<->architecture-view (every requirement described in overview.md) |
| II-1 | yes | information-item<->file (every 15289 information item resolves on disk) |
| II-2 | yes | information-item completeness (every core governed doc is registered in the 15289 map) |
| PR-1 | yes | process-outcome<->enforcement (every DoD 12207 outcome has a resolvable gate/artifact) |
| CM-1 | yes | CM status-accounting (every ADR file Status matches the ADR index register) |

### 2.3 Coverage gate

The PR Coverage Gate (c8 `--check-coverage`) fails under these floors: lines 95%,
statements 95%, functions 96%, branches 80%. Floors
ratchet up only (`npm run coverage:bump`); they are never lowered by hand.

### 2.4 Extension test suites

The Mocha extension activation + view-render suites run in the `extension tests` CI jobs on
`ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest`.

## 3. Configuration status accounting (ISO 10007 / ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207)

The controlled state of the repository's configuration items, derived from the registers:

| Configuration item class | Count | Register |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements (total) | 93 | docs/requirements/srs.md, rtm.csv |
| — Status: Proven | 92 | rtm.csv |
| — Status: Superseded | 1 | rtm.csv |
| Architecture decisions (ADRs) | 76 | docs/architecture/adr/README.md |
| Governed gates | 196 | experiments/verify-local-gates.mjs |
| Correspondence rules | 7 | experiments/reqs-coverage/verify-correspondences.mjs |
| Governed test items | 92 | docs/testing/test-plan.md |

Baselines are cut on the `main` branch via SemVer tags (GitFlow); each release is keyless-signed and
corroborated across planes before publication (see `docs/cm/cm-plan.md` and the release procedure).

## 4. Traceability

Every requirement's requirement ↔ view ↔ decision ↔ test ↔ code linkage is in the generated
traceability matrix (`docs/requirements/traceability-matrix.md`), itself gated by
`traceability-matrix-current`. This report and that matrix are the two generated, drift-gated views of
the same correspondence graph (ADR-0013).

## 5. Regeneration

`node experiments/reqs-coverage/generate-test-report.mjs` rewrites this file; `--check` (the
`test-report-current` gate) fails closed on drift, so the report can never silently lag the apparatus.

_Generated from 196 gates, 7 correspondence rules, 93 requirements, 76 ADRs, 92 test items._
