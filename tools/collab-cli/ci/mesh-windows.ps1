.SYNOPSIS
  Isolated-actor lbabus TCP/UDP MESH test (Windows host, Windows-container engine).

.DESCRIPTION
  Launches N containers from the lbabus Windows verification image on a user-defined docker network,
  each a DISTINCT named actor (VIHS_COLLAB_AGENT), fully ISOLATED -- no shared volume, no shared store.
  The actors coordinate ONLY through collab-cli's TCP/UDP bus (`lbabus net`, see ci/mesh-actor.ps1),
  resolving each other by container name. Each actor must hear from EVERY other actor over BOTH TCP
  (reliable frames) and UDP (presence beacons); when every actor exits 0, a complete TCP+UDP mesh formed.

  Exits 0 on a full mesh (all actors 0); 1 if any actor did not complete. Self-cleaning (removes the
  containers and the network on exit).

.EXAMPLE
  docker build -f tools/collab-cli/ci/Dockerfile.windows --target mesh -t lbabus-win-verify:mesh .
  pwsh -File tools/collab-cli/ci/mesh-windows.ps1 -Actors 3

# Scale the per-actor timeouts with N (parity with ci/mesh-linux.sh): a large mesh takes longer to fully

# sequentially, so early actors retry longer while late actors' listeners come up.

# UDP presence uses the SAME budget as TCP: at scale the mesh takes ~tcp_timeout to fully form, so a short
# UDP window expired before late beacons arrived (the old `30 + N` dropped UDP at 64). The listener's
# --count-distinct early-exit means this longer ceiling never slows a mesh that HAS formed.
