# Isolated-actor lbabus TCP/UDP MESH test (Linux host, Linux-container engine) -- parity of ci/mesh-windows.ps1.
#
# Launches N containers from the lbabus Linux verification image on a user-defined `bridge` network, each a
# DISTINCT named actor (VIHS_COLLAB_AGENT), fully ISOLATED -- no shared volume, no shared store. The actors
# coordinate ONLY through collab-cli's TCP/UDP bus (`lbabus net`, see ci/mesh-actor.sh), resolving each other
# by container name. Each actor must hear from EVERY other actor over BOTH TCP (reliable frames) and UDP
# (presence beacons); when every actor exits 0, a complete TCP+UDP mesh formed.
#
# Exits 0 on a full mesh (all actors 0); 1 if any actor did not complete. Self-cleaning.
